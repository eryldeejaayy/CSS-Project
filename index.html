    <strong>BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan),</strong> also known as the <em>Bangtan Boys</em>, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010 and debuting in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The septet—consisting of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope,
    RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own material. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres; their lyrics have often discussed mental health, the troubles of
    school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, and individualism. Their work also frequently references literature, philosophy and psychological concepts, and includes an alternate universe storyline.

    After launching in 2013 with their single album<i> 2 Cool 4 Skool</i>, BTS respectively released their first Korean-language studio album, Dark & Wild, and Japanese-language studio album, Wake Up, in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album,
    Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS had crossed into the global music market, leading the Korean wave into the United States and breaking several sales records. They became the first Korean
    ensemble to receive a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single "Mic Drop", as well as the first act from South Korea to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018).
    BTS became one of the few groups since the Beatles in 1966–1968 with four US number-one albums in less than two years, and Love Yourself: Answer (2018) was the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the first
    all-South Korean act to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200 with their Grammy-nominated single "Dynamite". Their follow-up releases "Savage Love", "Life Goes On", "Butter", and "Permission to Dance" made them the
    quickest act to earn four US number-one singles since Justin Timberlake in 2006.

    As of 2022, BTS is the<b> best-selling artist in South Korean history</b>, having sold in excess of 30 million albums via the Circle Chart, and their studio album Map of the Soul: 7 (2020) is the best-selling album of all time in South Korea.
    They are the first non-English-speaking and Asian act to hold sold-out concerts at Wembley Stadium and the Rose Bowl (Love Yourself World Tour in 2019), and were named the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's (IFPI) Global
    Recording Artist of the Year for both 2020 and 2021. The group's many accolades include multiple American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, Golden Disc Awards, and nominations for two Grammy Awards. In 2017, they partnered with UNICEF to
    establish the Love Myself anti-violence campaign, going on to address three sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. Featured on Time's international cover as "Next Generation Leaders" and dubbed the "Princes of Pop", BTS has also
    appeared on Time's lists of the 25 most influential people on the internet (2017–2019) and the 100 most influential people in the world (2019), and in 2018 became the youngest recipients of the Order of Cultural Merit from the President of South
    Korea for their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language.
